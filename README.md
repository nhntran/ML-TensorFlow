DEEP LEARNING WITH TENSORFLOW
-----------------------------

Quick notes from the course + codes to run in Mac terminal. If you want to learn more about TensorFlow, check out the great course ""Introduction to TensorFlow for Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning" by deeplearning.ai on Coursera.

The materials below were generated based on the tutorials from the course, with some modifications by me.

#### 1. Simple neural network

-   Codes: TF\_HelloWorld.py

#### 2. Basic ideas about Convolution

-   Codes: Convolutions\_basic.py

#### 3. Image classifier: Fashion dataset

-   Codes: TF\_fashion\_mnist.py

#### 4. The neural network that recognizes handwriting digit

-   Codes: TF\_hand\_writing\_recognition.py

#### 5. Image classifier: Horse versus human

-   Codes: TF\_Human\_horse.py, data: `horse-or-human`, `prediction` and `validation-horse-or-human` in the `data` folder
-   An image classifier to distinguish human or horse image using Convolutional Neural Networks

#### 6. Image classifier: Happy versus sad faces

-   Codes: F\_HappyVsSad\_Face.py, data: `happy-or-sad` folder
-   An image classifier to distinguish sad and happy icons with the accuracy greater than 99.9%
